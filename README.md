## What is JustDance
The project uses Panda3D and Audio to build a rythm game in which interactions between music and users are engaged. 

## Installation
To run the project you need to have both Panda3D version and Audio version compatible with python2.7 installed.
Specifically, you can download panda3D at [Panda3D official website](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php")  and Aubio from [Aubio official website](https://aubio.org/download).

### Possible Installation problem
The problem you might encounter to run this program is that you might find your version of your python only matches one of Panda3D and Audio. Since panda3D's stabled version only supports python2, you need to install aubio on python2 and compile panda3D on python2. 

## Run JustDance
After the installation, you run the program simply by cloning this repository and running commandLine below in the repository:

`ppython src/GUI.py`

## Demo
Here is a short demo that shows you how to play the game: [Demo](https://youtu.be/ZgFJ6O6PidU)
